OVID-19 Detection System using CNN & Flask
Unmasking COVID-19: AI-Powered X-Ray Detection with Flask
An AI-driven web application that uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze chest X-ray images and detect potential signs of COVID-19. Built with TensorFlow, Keras, and deployed using Flask, this system demonstrates how deep learning can augment healthcare screening and reduce diagnostic delays.

ðŸš€ Features
CNN-based Detection â€“ Binary classification: COVID-19 or Normal.

Image Preprocessing & Normalization â€“ Ensures optimal model accuracy.

Flask Web Interface â€“ Upload chest X-ray images or use a simulated camera capture.

Real-time Predictions â€“ Instant AI-powered results.

Secure File Handling â€“ Safe and efficient processing of medical images.

ðŸ§  How It Works
Preprocesses uploaded chest X-rays (resizing, normalization).

Runs inference using a trained CNN model (covid_model.h5).

Displays prediction results (COVID-19 / Normal) with confidence score.
